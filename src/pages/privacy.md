## Information We Collect
At AskRemotely, we collect your Google profile ID when you create an account using your Google account. We store your Google profile ID to link you to your future logins. We do not share your Google user data with any third parties.

If you import a file from Google Drive, we only access the file you explicitly select and confirm. We process the file on our end to build a document index and retain it to show citation sources. If you delete the file, we will delete it from our infrastructure within 30 days.

## How We Use Your Information
We use your personal information to provide and improve our services, communicate with you, and for other legitimate business purposes. We may also use non-personal information for analytics and to enhance your user experience.

## Data Security and Third-Party Services
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Our app shares textual data with AI model providers to build an index. You will be presented with a checkbox on the upload/import dialogue to acquire your explicit consent to share data with third-party providers for AI models.
